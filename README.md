## General Information
BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider, has experienced a revenue drop due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To recover post-lockdown, the company seeks to understand the demand for shared bikes. They have hired a consulting firm to analyze factors affecting bike demand in the American market, aiming to identify significant variables and how they influence demand. By modeling the demand with available data on daily bike usage and related factors, BoomBikes intends to adjust its business strategy to meet customer needs effectively and stand out in the market once the economy stabilizes, ultimately aiming for a strong recovery and increased profits.

Business Objective The goal is to model the demand for shared bikes using various independent variables. This model will help management understand how different factors affect bike demand, allowing them to adjust their business strategy to better meet customer needs and expectations. Additionally, the model will provide insights into demand dynamics in new markets

## Conclusions
Both the manual and automatic are good in their own way.
With 7 lesser columns , RFE is giving nearly the same results. The drawback being we don't get to choose business relevant columns.
Manual selection gives a slightly higher R2 score and we have the freedom to choose business relevant columns.
